# Mapping-Urban-Development-Pressure-in-San-Francisco-Through-Building-Permits
This project analyzes five years of San Francisco building permit data, covering nearly 200,000 records from 2013 to 2018. Using permit volume as a proxy for development pressure, it identifies high-activity neighborhoods, examines concentration patterns, and analyzes time trends to reveal sustained growth areas and emerging development hotspots.
# Problem Statement
Urban growth in San Francisco places uneven pressure on housing, infrastructure, and public services. However, there is limited neighborhood-level analysis that clearly shows where construction activity is most concentrated and how development pressure changes over time. This project addresses the challenge of using building permit data to identify high-pressure neighborhoods, assess concentration patterns, and distinguish sustained development trends from short-term construction surges to support data-driven urban planning decisions.
